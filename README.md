# Tifinagh-translit

A js script for Latin and Arabic transliteration of a Tifinagh text 
in the Furigana / Okurigana way of Japanese language. 
The idea is to make reading Tifinagh easier. 

Demo website is: [tifinagh.net](https://www.tifinagh.net/)

## TODO
 * [ ] Handle punctuation across scripts. 
 * [ ] Validate the Arabic script equivalence with Tifinagh.
 * [ ] Do more tests.
